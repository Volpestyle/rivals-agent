# L2 — HUD readers

**Status: done and accepted.** Waiting on one thing only: a run of deliberate
bot-tagging at varied distances, plus damage taken, at
`C:\rivals-agent\data\l1\tagrun\` on the PC (L4 is recording it, the lead will
say when it lands). That widens `read_tagged`'s calibration and supplies the
one missing digit template. Nothing depends on it.

`perception/hud.py` reads Spider-Man's practice-range HUD from one frame with
fixed regions and a template-matched digit classifier. No ML.
`tests/test_hud.py` passes on 145 hand-checked frames.

Owned here: `perception/hud.py`, `perception/hud_truth.json`,
`tests/test_hud*.py`, `docs/evidence/l2/`. Tracked as VUH-1294; the offline
integration lane that consumes these readers is `docs/lanes/l6-integration.md`
(VUH-1298).

## Results

145 hand-checked frames, from L1 runs `trial1` (70) and `run1` (75):

| field | coverage | wrong |
|---|---|---|
| hp | 0.979 | 0 |
| max_hp | 0.945 | 0 |
| bar_fill | 1.000 | 0 |
| webs | 0.986 | 0 |
| `ready`, all four slots | 0.993–1.000 | 0 |
| `charges` (swing, uppercut) | 0.979, 0.986 | 0 |
| ult_ready | 1.000 | 0 |

**Coverage** is the share of frames read correctly; a miss is a frame the reader
declined. **Wrong** is the share it answered incorrectly — zero on every field,
which is the property the readers are built for and the one the check asserts.

`read` costs **~4.3 ms** per frame measured quiet, `read_tagged` **~0.6 ms**;
both spread to tens of ms when several lanes load this Mac at once. Regions are
fractions of the frame and give identical answers at 960, 1280, 1920 and 2560
wide.

## What other lanes need to know

- **`Hud.state_kwargs()` fills `hp`, `max_hp`, `webs`, `abilities`** (with `ult`
  as an `Ability`). It deliberately leaves `frame` out — the caller owns the
  image: `State(t=t, frame=(w, h), **hud.state_kwargs())`.
- **`ult_charge`, `bar_fill` and the `teamup` slot stay on `Hud` and out of
  `State`** — the brain does not use them (lead's call). They are still read and
  still available to anything that wants them; `state_kwargs()` simply does not
  pass them on.
- **`read_tagged(frame, bbox)`** takes an `agent.state.Detection` box and
  answers whether that enemy carries a Spider-Tracer: `True`, `False`, or
  `None` when the band above the box falls outside the frame. It does not need
  the detector to be accurate to the pixel — the band is sized from the box.
- **Slot 1 is the team-up ability, not the Spider-Tracer.** Pressing Y turns the
  other icons gold and raises max hp by 50, which then decays back to 250 over
  about a minute. The tracer is a mark on an enemy, read by `read_tagged`. The
  slot key is `teamup`.
- **The ability row is laid out per hero.** The four slot centres in `SLOT_CX`
  are Spider-Man's; Human Torch has five slots at other positions. Everything
  else (hp, bar, ammo, ult) is hero-independent.
- **Max hp is not constant.** It moved between 250 and 300 across both runs as
  the team-up buff ticked down. Anything treating 250 as Spider-Man's health
  will be wrong for stretches of a run.
- **A menu or loading screen returns an empty `Hud`**, not a row of "not ready".
- **`State.on_target` cannot be read from the crosshair.** It is the same small
  white square whether or not a hostile is under it — checked across 1544 frames,
  32 of them with an enemy box over screen centre, with 1507 plain white dots and
  no red ones at all. No reader was built. `agent.brain.aimed_at` already falls
  back to crosshair-in-bbox geometry when the field is None, which is right.

## Decisions

- **Unknown over guess, everywhere.** Each reader has layout checks — a number
  must land at its anchor, be the only thing in its band, and have no
  digit-shaped ink spilling out of it — and returns `None` when they fail. This
  is why the labelled set shows zero wrong reads and why coverage is not 100%.
- **Templates are learned from values a human read, not from labelled glyph
  images.** `python -m perception.hud learn <frame>=hp:300/300;webs:5 ...`
  assigns labels positionally, so a template can only be mislabelled if the
  hand-read value was wrong. Hand-labelling glyph bitmaps was tried first and
  put a scenery blob in the bank as a digit.
- **Ready vs cooling is decided by colour, not brightness.** A red cooling icon
  can be brighter than a thin white ready one, and a buffed icon is gold. The
  test is what share of the icon's ink is red.
- **`python -m perception.hud learn` prints to stdout.** It used to write
  `glyphs.py` into the working directory, which left a stray file at the repo
  root for someone else to puzzle over. Redirect it where you want it.
- **Damage numbers and hit markers are not read.** Damage numbers float away
  from the hit and fade, so no fixed region holds them. A crosshair hit marker
  was built, measured against L1's pad log, and removed: it fired on 29 of 66
  frames where no button was pressed at all — Spider-Man's own web VFX fill
  that region. If L5 needs damage, the honest path is the scoreboard or the
  practice range's own damage readout, not the crosshair.

## Open

- **No template for the digit `1`.** It appears in neither run: hp only ever
  took 250 and 252–300. An hp of 217 reads `None`, not a wrong number. The
  damage taken in `tagrun` will supply it; one `learn` pass then fixes it.
- **`read_tagged` is calibrated on one tagging episode** (trial1 frames 71–86,
  one bot, one distance). In the 1197 `run1` frames I hold, the web-cluster
  bursts hit scenery rather than bots, so they contain no tagged enemies.
  `tagrun` is being recorded for this; until it lands, the five-scale search
  covers other distances on reasoning rather than measurement. The large web-splat VFX scores 0.45–0.53 against
  the tracer template, below the 0.60 match threshold, so it yields `None` or
  `False` — never a false `True`.
- **The ammo box is cropped tight enough that a two-digit count would clip.**
  Fine for Spider-Man's Web-Cluster; another hero may need the box widened.
